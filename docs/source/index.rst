oscillo - Always better than DEX
===================================

oscillo_ is a trading protocol with gasless transactions with an order book system similar to centralized exchanges. Traders are able to use gasless transactions to make limit orders. oscillo sends these transactions to the blockchain and pays the transaction fee. When using oscillo, traders do not have to provide native tokens such as ETH or MATIC for gas. Their assets remain in their wallet until the moment their order processes.
