How does oscillo works?
=======================


1. A maker/taker creates an order
2. The order is hashed, and the maker/taker signs the order cryptographically.
3. The order is submitted to the order book.
4. oscillo matches the submitted orders.
5. oscillo verifies the maker/taker's digital signature and looks through all the conditions of the trade. If everything is correct, the assets will be transferred from the maker/taker wallets. If not, the transaction is canceled.
