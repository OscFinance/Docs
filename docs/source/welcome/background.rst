Why did we build oscillo?
=========================

The cryptocurrency market experiences many ups and downs as it grows. These ups and downs give enormous trading opportunities for crypto-traders. Decentralized exchanges including AMMs also grow as cryptoâ€™s trading volume increases. However, AMMs have many defects, which always results in asset loss of some kind via slippage or impermanent loss. The process by which validators process transactions can also lead to unexpected asset loss through frontrunning, sandwiching, etc. Users have had to use unreasonable processes in an effort to reduce asset losses. We built oscillo to fix these problems and trade cheaper and safer.
