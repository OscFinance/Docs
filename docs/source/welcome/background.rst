Why did we build oscillo?
=========================

There were many ups and downs as the crypto market grows. These ups and downs gave enormous trading opportunities for crypto-traders.
Decentral exchanges called AMM also grows as the trading volume gets bigger.
But because of AMM's defect, asset loss always occurs via the slippage and impermanent loss. And the process by which validators put some of the transactions in a block can lead to unexpected asset loss by frontrunning and sandwiching etc.
We should have gone through unreasonable processes like splitting transaction volume to reduce these asset losses. We built oscillo to trade cheaper and safer. We hope other crypto-traders also trade comfortably via oscillo.
