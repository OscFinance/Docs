Key features
============

- Fair Price: At DEXs, you sell the token cheaper and buy more expensive than expected unavoidably because of the price impact. But you can trade by the price you order at oscillo.
- Lowest fees: oscillo is built for all crypto traders including us. There is no protocol fee and gas fees are much lower than AMMs. (If it is difficult to cover operating costs due to the traffic, a small fee may be added in the future. However, we will always keep the lowest fee.)
- No slippage: oscillo doesn't use liquidity pools of AMM. So there's no slippage however the amount you trade.
- Mev-resistance: All trades in oscillo use the limit price that you submitted. Because the submitted price won't change, it's impossible for any value to be extracted by placing transactions in a certain order.
